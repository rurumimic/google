# How to Work Well on Teams

book: [How to Work Well on Teams](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch02.html)

about the cultural and social aspects of software engineering at Google.

- Humans are mostly a collection of intermittent bugs.  
- Software development is a team endeavor

## Help Me Hide My Code

insecurity is actually a symptom of a larger problem.

## The Genius Myth

The Genius Myth is the tendency that we as humans need to ascribe the success of a team to a single person/leader.

_Hide away until your code is perfect._

Google assert that you’re doing it wrong, and it is a big deal. Here’s why.

## Hding Consiered Harmful

### Early Detection

Fail early, fail fast, fail often.

### The Bus Factor

**Bus factor** (noun): _the number of people that need to get hit by a bus before your project is completely doomed._

You need that second pair of eyes.

### Pace of Progress

**DevOps philosophy**: _get feedback as early as possible, test as early as possible, and think about security and production environments as early as possible._

**shifting left** in the developer workflow.

Answer: by working in a team.

### In Short, Don’t Hide

working alone is inherently riskier than working with others.

## It's All About the Team

software engineering is a team endeavor.

### Three pillars

1. Humility
2. Respect
3. Trust

"Man, you totally got the control flow wrong on that method there.  You should be using the standard xyzzy code pattern like everyone else."   
→    
"Hey, I'm confused by the control flow in this section here. I wonder if the xyzzy code pattern might make this clearer and easier to maintain?"

### Humility, Respect, and Trust in Practice

1. Lose the ego
2. Learn to give and take criticism
3. Fail fast and iterate

### Blameless Post-Mortem Culture

**post-mortem**:

1. a medical examination of a dead person's body in order to find out the cause of death
1. a discussion of an event after it has happened, especially of what was wrong with it or why it failed

#### Good postmortem

- A brief summary of the event
- A timeline of the event, from discovery through investigation to resolution
- The primary cause of the event
- Impact and damage assessment
- A set of action items (with owners) to fix the problem immediately
- A set of action items to prevent the event from happening again
- Lessons learned

### Being Googley

### Thrives in ambiguity

Can deal with conflicting messages or directions, build consensus, and make progress against a problem, even when the environment is constantly shifting.

### Values feedback

Has humility to both receive and give feedback gracefully and understands how valuable feedback is for personal (and team) development.

### Challenges status quo

Is able to set ambitious goals and pursue them even when there might be resistance or inertia from others.

### Puts the user first

Has empathy and respect for users of Google’s products and pursues actions that are in their best interests.

### Cares about the team

Has empathy and respect for coworkers and actively works to help them without being asked, improving team cohesion.

### Does the right thing

Has a strong sense of ethics about everything they do; willing to make difficult or inconvenient decisions to protect the integrity of the team and product.

## Conclusion

**Well-functioning team** is the foundation for almost any software endeavor.
